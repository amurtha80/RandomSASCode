# RandomSASCode
Various snippets of SAS code that I have accumulated since starting to code in SAS in 2011


### findObsByFilterandRestrictObs2Filter.sas
This SAS script looks for observations based on a filter criteria, and only returns the values based on that criteria.

In this example we are looking for observations for people with an account type of LST, however, we also want to only return observations where the those people only have an account type of LST.
